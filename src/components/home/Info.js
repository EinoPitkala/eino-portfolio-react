      <p>
      Hi! I'm Eino Pitkälä, I'm from Kuopio, Finland. I am 14 years old and
        besides school, I work as an entrepreneur in my own company, Eino IT. I
        am interested in coding in different languages and I am learning to code
        more and more all the time. I do small projects with React and for my
        company's clients, I usually make websites with WordPress.
